The only distinction among these variants is the turning quality, vinyl stickers and the experience of solving the puzzle. The design of each of these variants also varies immensely. The DaYan Gem 6 (in image) has 30 faces and six large octahedrons with 24 small faces. On the other hand, the Da Yan Gem 3 is a tetrakaidecahedron-shaped puzzle. All the DaYan Gem puzzles together make a great collection. \r\n\r\nThe Quadruple Cube extends far out of the boundaries of the Rubik’s cube. It is a unique modification of the traditional Rubik’s Cube. To say the least, it shaped like a cube within a cube within a cube and so on! This definitely is a challenging puzzle with impressive aesthetics.

It is considered one of the hardest Rubik’s Cubes to solve. For many, the traditional cube is hard enough, but this take on Ernő Rubik’s classic is enough to scare even the most tempered Rubik’s Cube enthusiast.\r\n\r\nIt is made from 975 individual parts and more than 1,200 stickers. Jason Smith designed it and took about 75 hours to build. As for solving it — that might take considerably longer than that in the hands of a beginner.","imageUrl":"https://images.interestingengineering.com/img/iea/yrwQAqvQwN/interesting-rubiks-cube-pentamix.jpg","level":"6"}]
